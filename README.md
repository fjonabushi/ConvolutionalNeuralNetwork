Cell Image Processing Using Convolutional Neural Network. 
This Project was submitted as a Master's Diploma thesis at Epoka University by Fjona Bushi Hajdari. 
The convolutional Network used is a variation of the LeNet network. 
The research was based on three datasets of 9332, 20102 and 12520 images which were trained and tested separately. 
The purpose of the research was to succesfully predict healthy/unhealthy cell images. 
The preprocessing methods used are unsharped masking, median filter and highpass filter. 

Please note that his project lacks the dataset and only has the source code avaliable for now.
